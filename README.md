###Getting Started with React Redux
React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.\

#Installation
React Redux 8.x requires React 16.8.3 or later / React Native 0.59 or later, in order to make use of React Hooks.\
